/**
 * Invoice status state machine (issue #468).
 *
 * The lifecycle maps onto the stored statuses as follows:
 *
 *   draft (submitted) → pending (under review) → published (active)
 *     → funded → settled
 *
 * with `rejected` reachable from draft/pending and `cancelled` as an escape
 * hatch before settlement. `failed` is set by the maturity job when a
 * published invoice is still not fully funded at its due date. Sellers may still publish a draft directly, which
 * is the existing self-serve flow; `pending` is the path for invoices that go
 * through admin review first.
 *
 * Every status change must go through {@link InvoiceStateMachine.transition}
 * so the graph, role checks and preconditions are enforced in one place, the
 * change is recorded in `invoice_status_history`, and side effects fire
 * exactly once after the change is committed.
